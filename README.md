# EV-Price-Prediction-ML
This project implements a Supervised Machine Learning (ML) framework to accurately predict the cost of an Electric Vehicle (EV) based on its key features and specifications. This is fundamentally a regression problem, aiming to determine a continuous value (price) from a set of input variables (features).
